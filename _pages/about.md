I am a Ph.D. candidate from [BZ Lab](https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~yfzhou/), School of Computer Science, [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) (supervised by Prof. Yangfan Zhou and Prof. Xin Wang). I received a B.Sc degree in Computer Science from Fudan University in 2021. My research interests are memory disaggregation, RDMA systems and storage systems.
